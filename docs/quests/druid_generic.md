# Druid Generic Quest

Based on Ironfang Invasion ch1-2. 5 levels.

## Concept

Nirmathas forest. Hobgoblin army invades, you lead guerrilla resistance. Nature fights back against the invaders.

same for all orders, may have ot get createive for per order flavour?

hobgobs are kinda shitters so may want to do gnolls as well, or just elites, though that's lazy

Reclaim ranger fortresses from monsters.

- Ambush encounters
- do some inclusions with, pretty much just littel huts and outposts - maybe optinal but what's the point?

### Level 5: Ibzairiak's Lair
Confront the black dragon who broke the Rangers.
