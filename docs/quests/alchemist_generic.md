# Alchemist Generic Quest

Based on Carrion Crown ch2. 5 levels.

## Concept

Lepidstadt, Ustalav. The Beast (flesh golem) is on trial for murders. mad scientist creator bad, choice like dnh drow treason stuff

## Structure

### Level 1: Home
Get the quest. Travel to Lepidstadt, need to flesh this out (pun not intended) cos it's a bit bare bones (pun intended).

### Level 2,3: r&c filler, "investigation sites" so maybe some pre-canned rooms
Morast - swamp village, Sanctuary/Hergstag - burned hospital and abandoned village
- Swamp creatures
- Undead
- Manticore or similar beast
- Ghosts
- Homunculi
- Alchemical remnants

### Level 4: Creator's Lab
Lab where creature was made, in theory have "evidence" here so can shortcut back to trial - maybe then get buff to take on 5 - is there a reason to take on 5 without the buff (other than traitor path?)
- Alchemical creatures
- Constructs
- Traps

### Level 5: Schloss Caromarc
- Flesh golems
- Aberrations
- Boss: the mad alchemist or his greatest creation
- **Side with creator**: Learn his secrets, unlock some prc? alternatie QA (not that we know what we want lol)


do we want beast as pet? it's a bit of a swing from an alchemist so seems a bit poo but then I am not good at nh and probably SHOULD use pets more?
