# Swashbuckler Quest (Pirates)

Based on Skull & Shackles ch1-2. 5 levels.

## Structure

### Level 1: Home
this is a bit combiend with gun path, need to work out how to fork it?

### Level 2: Ship (bilge)
- Bilge creatures
- Rats
- Sailors

### Level 3: Ship (decks)
- Officers
- Ship hazards
- Grindylows (boarding)

2 and 3 are shitty r&c filler mostly?

### Level 4: DECK
- Loyalists
- Boss: captain

### Level 5: Port raid
- Town guards
- Rival pirates
- Boss: port master or rival captain
- boardin ganother ship would be rad but might jus tbe the same level twice? does it matter?

## Notes

- Quest giver: ally on ship
- Nemesis: Captain Harrigan (in the port?)
- can we do some cannon fun? what would it even look like?
  - maybe random canonfire raking the ship as you move, probably need a round warning or just everyone takes damage tough luck to be you, might be a bit crapola if it just wipes the player with no agency though
