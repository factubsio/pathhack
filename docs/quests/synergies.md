# Quest Synergies (Aspirational)

Resolution: 3-tuple > 2-tuple > fallback

## Strong Synergies

### (warpriest, iomedae)
Wrath of the Righteous ch1-2. Her crusade. Perfect fit.

### (warpriest, sarenrae)
Legacy of Fire ch1-2. Qadiran setting, redemption themes.

### (warpriest, irori)
Fists of the Ruby Phoenix. Martial perfection tournament.

### (warpriest, lamashtu)
Kingmaker ch2 (Rivers Run Red) - ally with Tsanna's cult, Womb of Lamashtu content. Invert the usual "destroy the cult" framing.

## Ideas / Unassigned

### Irori + martial race?
(kasatha, *, irori) - 4-armed perfection seeker, Ruby Phoenix feels right

### Lamashtu general
She's villain in many APs - could do "custom inclusions" for most combos rather than dedicated chapters

## Class Fallbacks

### warpriest (no deity synergy)
Giantslayer ch1-2 (Battle of Bloodmarch Hill, Hill Giant's Pledge). Defend town, slay giants. Deity-agnostic holy warrior stuff.

### oracle (no mystery synergy)
Stolen Fate ch1 (The Choosing). Harrow deck, fate, prophecy. Peak oracle vibes.
