# Warpriest Generic Quest

Based on Giantslayer ch1-2. 5 levels. deity champion defending town - not sure how to swing this for a C/E deity but we maybe we can make the town have a shrine to that deity so they do be mad the orcs be coming to trash?

## Quest Artifact

**Rune of the Crusader** (transferable fundamental rune)
- UNIQUE: can be removed and applied to another weapon (normally runes are permanent)
- Only applies to deity's favored weapon type
- Effects (all active, not choose)
  - +2 weapon dice (striking q2)
  - +1d4 accuracy (bonus q1)
  - +1d6 holy damage (deity can change damage type) - 1d6 is a bit crapola, but we can maybe make holy damage less resistably or something, still a bit poo? Is it needed if we have other effects?
  - When wielded: TBD - something like mres, resistance, speed, regen, etc
  - Invoke: TBD - refresh blessing? burst heal? smite?
  - rune is super flexible so it's giving "slotless" extrinsics, so possibly numbers don't need to be too mad good

### Level 1: Trunau (home)
- No combat, quest giver, town NPCs
- should have combat? Dunno, some of the home stuff in nh is kinda pointless, some is pretty scary?

### Level 2: Siege
- Advanced/Barbarian Orcs (base + template - need to make templates :sigh:)
- Orc Commanders
- Dire wolves
- Flood trolls (near moat/river)
- Siege engines as destructible objectives - spawn more dudes when hit

### Level 3: Tomb Beneath
- Skeleton orcs / Skeleton hill giant (ancient guardians)
- Zombie orcs? (Skreed's victims - potential, zombie is more fresh kill so would need to have been from recent)
- Spiders (Ogre Spider, Giant Tarantula, poison spam to really make the player quit)
- Gryphs? (filler, maybe skip)
- **Skreed** (half-orc alchemist) + dire wolves - mini-boss

### Level 4: Redlake Fort Outer r&c filler
- Orc patrols (Veteran Master, Doomsayer)
- Trolls (standard, Two-Headed)
- Ambush rooms: enter empty room, enemies spawn at doors/edges (surrounded) like a magic trap but only the ambush bit

### Level 5: Redlake Fort Inner (goal)
- Elite orcs, Orc Veteran Masters
- Troll Warleader
- Manticore or Drake (optional big beast, time optinoal? return later for (like moon U)? alternate boss for different QA? seems like hard work)
- **Grenseldek** (hill giant chieftain, buffed ~CR 12) - boss


## Notes
we can swap out level 3 possibly for other deity/race stuff? it's a bit more standalone though it is supposed to have the relic (which is missing) - can come back to later
