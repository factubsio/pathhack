# Warpriest Generic Quest

Based on Giantslayer ch1-2. 5 levels.

## Structure

### 1. Trunau (home)
Quest giver, town under threat. Get the mission.
- INCLUSION: deity-specific shrine room

### 2. Siege
Orc assault on the walls. Destroy siege engines (catapults, rams) while fighting through.
- INCLUSION: race-specific NPCs? (half-orc tension)

### 3. Tomb Beneath
Ancient giant tomb under town. Retrieve relic before enemies do.
- LEVEL HOOK: can swap entire level for deity-specific variant
- Portal exit to level 4 (no backtrack)

### 4. Belkzen Crossing
Travel level through orc territory. Hostile terrain.
- Filler, but could have race-based encounter variants

### 5. Redlake Fort (goal)
Grenseldek (hill giant chieftain) boss. Get the artifact.
- INCLUSION: deity-specific artifact variant?

## Quest Artifact

**Rune of the Crusader** (transferable FUNDAMENTAL rune)
- UNIQUE: can be removed and applied to another weapon (normally runes are permanent)
- Only applies to deity's favored weapon type
- Effects (combines striking + bonus + extras):
  - +2 weapon dice (striking q2)
  - +1d4 accuracy (bonus q1)
  - +1d6 holy damage (HOOK: deity can change damage type)
  - When wielded: TBD - something like mres, resistance, speed, regen, etc
