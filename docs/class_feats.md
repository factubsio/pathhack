# Class Feats Design

## Structure

- 9 class feats total over 20 levels
- Mix of class-specific and shared feats
- PrC/Dedication system for multiclass flavor

## PrC/Dedication Rules

**Ratio:** PrC feats ≤ floor(class feats / 2)
- 2 class → 1 PrC max
- 4 class → 2 PrC max
- 6 class → 3 PrC max

Can take in any order as long as legal at each step. Front-load class, back-load PrC if desired.

## PrC Design

Each PrC is exactly 3 feats:
- Feat 1: Entry, may be modest or even negative (Lichdom)
- Feat 2: Core abilities
- Feat 3: Capstone

Feats can grant multiple abilities or none. Flexible per PrC.

**Prereqs can include:**
- Level requirements
- Deity restrictions
- Race restrictions
- Stat requirements
- Event/activity requirements (found location, killed boss, etc.)

**Late-locked PrCs** (level 10+ entry) can front-load power since you waited.

**Long con PrCs** (Lichdom): weak/negative feat 1+2, mega capstone at feat 3 (level 18+). High risk, high reward.

## Shared Feats

Classes can share feat pools:
- Divine casters (Warpriest + Oracle): Channel Smite, Cremate Undead, Sap Life
- Martial classes: combat stance stuff?
- Arcane casters: spell penetration stuff?

Reduces total feats to write, makes related classes feel connected.

## PrC Ideas

**Early access:**
- Shadowdancer (stealth/teleport)
- Assassin (death attack)
- Arcane Archer (spell + bow)

**Mid access:**
- Holy Vindicator (divine tank)
- Hellknight (law/armor)
- Rage Prophet (oracle/barb)

**Late/Long con:**
- Lichdom (undead transformation, feat 1 is negative, must take at level 4)
- Apotheosis (demigod)
- Mythic Champion

## Class Feat Philosophy

Class feats can be smaller/more numerous than general feats since you get 9 vs 4. Less pressure per feat. Can have niche/situational ones.

Feats should enhance class identity:
- Blessing enhancers for warpriest
- Mystery enhancers for oracle
- Ki enhancers for monk
