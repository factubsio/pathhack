# Class Feats Design

## Structure

- 9 class feats total over 20 levels
- Mix of class-specific and shared feats
- do some horror mix of prc and 2e dedication stuff

## PrC Rules

1 prc feat for every 2 class feats so:
- 2 class → 1 PrC max
- 4 class → 2 PrC max
- 6 class → 3 PrC max

Can take in any order as long as legal at each step, note: not same as 2e rules of have to dedicate more to this one, can dip if want

Each PrC is exactly 3 feats:
- Feat 1: STUFF (may be modest or even negative (Lichdom))
- Feat 2: STUFF
- Feat 3: STUFF

Feats can grant multiple abilities or features or whatever we want

**Prereqs can include:**
- Level requirements
- Deity restrictions
- Race restrictions
- Stat requirements (lame?)
- Event/activity requirements (found location, killed boss, took choice blah blah)

tbh a bunch of these may not be balanced but prc is all about taking you to flavour town central and that's the main thing.

you can take my dawnflower anchorite from my cold dead hands but they won't be cold cos sarsar will be keeping me warm.

## Shared Feats

Classes can share feat pools:
- Divine casters (Warpriest + Oracle): Channel Smite, Cremate Undead, Sap Life
- Martial classes: combat stance stuff?
- Arcane casters: spell penetration stuff?

Reduces total feats to write lazy bubbles

## PrC Ideas

**Early access:**
- Shadowdancer (stealth/teleport)
- Assassin (death attack)
- Arcane Archer (spell + bow)

**Mid access:**
- Holy Vindicator (divine tank)
- Hellknight (law/armor)
- Rage Prophet (oracle/barb)

**Late/Long con:**
- Lichdom (undead transformation, feat 1 is negative, must take at level 4)
- Apotheosis (demigod)
- Mythic Champion

all of these are random crap, but maybe will help.

prc I plan to pull from prc, arche, and base class of 1e and 2e classes not included directrly

like: gunslinger probably too sparse for a base class, barb too (me shout hit rah?) but we can include some noddy version of them as prc dips, so some rage powers etc without a. hving to implement a million things, and b. letting char be a bit more custom?

## Class Feat Philosophy

Class feats can be smaller/more numerous than general feats since you get 9 vs 4. Less pressure per feat. Can have niche/situational ones.

Class Feats should enhance class identity:
- Blessing enhancers for warpriest
- Mystery enhancers for oracle
- Ki enhancers for monk

PrC feats should msotly be class-adjacent but we'll see

class feats should be mostly passive (?) since granted features give actives a lot of the time, but I think less of a rule than general feats that really should be passive. pa and friends are already suepr gray area
