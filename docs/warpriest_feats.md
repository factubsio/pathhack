# Warpriest Class Feats

## Core Class Features (granted, not feats)

- Sacred Weapon (scaling damage with favored weapon)
- Blessings (chosen at level 1, cooldown-based)
  - minor/major effect
  - chooe another?
- Spell slots (5 levels)
- Medium armor + favored weapon proficiency
- Fervor (TODO)

## Fervor

Cooldown-based ability (~60 turns), like blessings. Uses:
- Swift-cast any spell (costs fervor + slot)
- Quick self-heal (costs fervor only)
- Enhance weapon with property (flaming/holy/etc, duration)


this combines fervor with sacred weapon enhancements, otherwise too many buttons?

maybe is ok and we split it back out, but por for now

Class feats can reduce cooldown, add charges, enhance effects.
