# Warpriest Class Feats

## Core Class Features (granted, not feats)

- Sacred Weapon (scaling damage with favored weapon)
- Blessings (chosen at level 1, cooldown-based)
- Spell slots (5 levels)
- Medium armor + favored weapon proficiency
- Fervor (TODO)

## Fervor

Cooldown-based ability (~60 turns), like blessings. Uses:
- Swift-cast any spell (costs fervor + slot)

Class feats can reduce cooldown, add charges, enhance effects.
