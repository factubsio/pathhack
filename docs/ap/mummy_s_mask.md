## Chapters

### The Half-Dead City

The Mummy's Mask Adventure Path begins with "The Half-Dead City," an exciting new adventure in the pyramid-laden realm of Osirion, Land of Pharaohs! In the city of Wati, the church of Pharasma holds a lottery allowing explorers to delve the tombs of the city's vast necropolis in search of the nation's lost glories. In the course of investigating dusty tombs and fighting their ancient guardians and devious traps, the heroes encounter a group of rival adventurers intent on keeping one tomb's treasures for themselves. At the same time, the heroes learn that a dangerous artifact has been stolen from the tomb. Can the adventurers defeat their rivals, or will they fall to the undead defenders of the city's necropolis?

### Empty Graves

Following the opening of its necropolis, the city of Wati is overrun by hordes of the unquiet dead. The heroes must once more brave the abandoned streets and dusty tombs of Wati's necropolis in search of the powerful artifact called the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh, as well as the necromancer who is using it to create the undead uprising. But mysterious masked cultists also seek the artifact so they can bring a pharaoh from the ancient past back to life. Can the heroes defeat the evil necromancer and return the deceased to their graves, or will Wati truly become a city of the dead?

### Shifting Sands

To learn more about the ancient Pharaoh Hakotep I and the secretive cult that wants to revive him, the heroes travel to the city of Tephu to explore the vast archives in its Great Library. This is no small task, as they must contend with those who wish such knowledge to remain forgotten. With the clues they discover, the heroes venture deep into Osirion's uncharted deserts in search of the tomb of Hakotep's master pyramid-builder. There they face not only dangerous denizens of the desert, but the cult of the Forgotten Pharaoh—cultists who will stop at nothing to ensure their god-king remains undisturbed.

### Secrets of the Sphinx

Deep in the Osirian desert stands the blank-faced monument known as the Sightless Sphinx. In search of the stolen mummy of Chisisek, the architect of the flying tomb of the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I, the heroes track the cult of the Forgotten Pharaoh to its secret headquarters inside the sphinx. There they must face monstrous mercenaries and servants of the demon lord Areshkagal before finally confronting the masked cultists and their leader, the Forgotten Pharaoh, who has been possessed by a fragment of Hakotep's soul.

### The Slave Trenches of Hakotep

The Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I has risen and launched an attack against the city of Wati! The heroes return to Wati to defend it against this menace, only to discover that the attack is just the preface to a larger invasion of Osirion, controlled from Hakotep's own flying tomb. Journeying to the Slave Trenches of Hakotep, the heroes must learn how to activate an ancient weapon to pull Hakotep's tomb back to earth. Will the heroes bring down the flying pyramid of the Sky Pharaoh, or will their bones join the thousands of skeletons that lie crumbling within the Slave Trenches of Hakotep?

### Pyramid of the Sky Pharaoh

Hakotep's flying pyramid has been grounded, but the heroes must enter the ancient tomb to deactivate the fleet of smaller flying pyramids poised to attack Osirion. Deep inside the Pyramid of the Sky Pharaoh, an untouched tomb from the heights of Ancient Osirion, the heroes face undying guardians woken from ageless sleep, climaxing in a final battle with the reborn Sky Pharaoh Hakotep himself. Will the heroes defeat Hakotep and reunite the pieces of his sundered soul to send it into the Great Beyond, or will Osirion enter a new age under the rule of an undead mummy from the distant past?
