## Chapters

### Mantle of Gold

Invited to a prestigious storytelling festival in Highhelm, the greatest dwarven city in Golarion, a clan's eclectic guests explore every corner of the metropolis to build their own legends. Yet when these budding celebrities find a relic linked to one of dwarvenkind's greatest heroes, they're drawn into a mysterious ancient urban intrigue that kicks off a deadly treasure hunt. The Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path begins with "Mantle of Gold," a complete adventure for 1st- to 5th-level characters.

### Cult of the Cave Worm

Finding a legendary tomb requires tracking an equally legendary cave worm said to dwell there. As the adventurers set out from Highhelm, they must brave the Darklands' dangers, navigate a treacherous fey city, and recover the relic that retraces the cave worm's path. Yet in doing so, they learn of nefarious rivals who also seek the tomb—rivals the adventurers might stop by infiltrating an unforgiving underground metropolis.

### Heavy is the Crown

For all his epic deeds, the first high king earned countless enemies, and word of his tomb's rediscovery has gathered an eclectic army of dwarves' ancient enemies. To preserve the tomb and save a dwarven city, the adventurers must infiltrate, splinter, and sabotage the gathering legion. Only in this chaos can the adventurers catch up to their rival at the tomb itself. The question isn't just whether they can prevail, but whether their victory makes them worthy of the tomb's greatest secrets.
