### Zombie Feast

Dispatched to look into strange events at a farm tended by zombie workhands, the characters find a grave threat to the living population in the undead-dominated nation of Geb.

### Graveclaw

The mysterious mastermind behind this plot stalks the halls of power, where the characters now tread, and he knows that his enemies are closing in!
