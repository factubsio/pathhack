## Chapters

### Hellknight Hill

Fires burn atop the ruined citadel on Hellknight Hill, sending plumes of red smoke into the air that could be a call for help. Within the old keep, strange invaders from a distant land, mysterious long-lost ruins, and the machinations of a shadowy organization await discovery. Something dire is building toward an apocalyptic event, and it falls to your characters to stop the end before it begins. The Age of Ashes Adventure Path begins with "Hellknight Hill"—a complete adventure for 1st- to 4th-level characters.

### Cult of Cinders

The citadel atop Hellknight Hill has been claimed, along with the ring of ancient portals in its basement. What dangers lie beyond this magical portal, and what do the cultists who've used it before have in store? There's only one way to find out: the heroes must travel through to the lands beyond, where they will make new allies, face new enemies, and do much, much more! The Age of Ashes Adventure Path continues with "Cult of Cinders"—a complete adventure for 5th–8th level characters.

### Tomorrow Must Burn

In defeating the treacherous Cult of Cinders, the heroes discover a nefarious group pulling the cult's strings—a mysterious merchant's guild called the Scarlet Triad. Following clues and utilizing another portal found below their castle on Hellknight Hill, the heroes come to the recently founded nation of Ravounel, where they must stand against the Scarlet Triad as the group attempts to establish an underground slave trade. But as the heroes clash more and more with the Scarlet Triad, it becomes increasingly apparent the slavers have even more sinister plans for the Inner Sea region—plans that must be stopped!

### Fires of the Haunted City

The Scarlet Triad—slavers at the center of a vast conspiracy—have been tracked to the Five Kings Mountains. There, in the subterranean city of Saggorak, the slavers have forged an alliance with a terrifying dragon. To stop them, the heroes must navigate a complex political landscape and perhaps make an alliance of their own with a dwarven king who's been dead for thousands of years! The Age of Ashes Adventure Path continues with Fires of the Haunted City, a complete adventure for 12th- to 14th-level characters.

### Against the Scarlet Triad

The slavers known as the Scarlet Triad have been defeated twice before, and now the time has come for the heroes to confront them in their stronghold in the sprawling city of Katapesh. But the Triad still enjoys the support of the city's government; before the organization can be destroyed, the PCs will need to undermine the Triad's reputation, a task requiring guile, force of arms, and luck. The Age of Ashes Adventure Path continues with "Against the Scarlet Triad", a complete adventure for 15th- to 17th-level characters.

### Broken Promises

The city of Promise was founded in order to create a utopia, but the revelation of a sinister agenda pursued by the city's highest authority could spell disaster. With knowledge of the conspiracy, the PCs must find a way to navigate the complex politics of a city ruled by a dragon—while simultaneously enduring in the face of the growing fury of a dragon god! The Age of Ashes Adventure Path concludes with "Broken Promises," a complete adventure for 18th- to 20th-level characters.
