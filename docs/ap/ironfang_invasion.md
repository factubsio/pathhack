## Chapters

### Trail of the Hunted

The Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path launches with "Trail of the Hunted," a tale of desperate survival set against the invasion of a ruthless hobgoblin army—the Ironfang Legion! As the Ironfang Legion begins carving out an empire of monsters, the heroes must flee their hometown of Phaendar as it burns, saving any lives they can. The heroes guard their band of survivors in the wilderness, challenge a troglodyte tribe for safe haven, and face the brutal bounty hunters dispatched to end their flight to freedom!

### Fangs of War

Even as the adventurers find sanctuary in the Fangwood Forest, dire threats encroach on their woodland haven. The black dragon Ibzairiak the Scar-Maker, leading a contingent of Ironfang troops, has broken the back of the legendary Chernasardo Rangers who once defended the woods—and he has claimed the southern Fangwood as his own. With the Chernasardo Rangers gone, all of Fangwood Forest's deadliest inhabitants are again free to stalk and revel as they please, with the adventurers and their vulnerable refugees trapped in the middle. Alone and desperate for allies, the adventurers must siege the Rangers' fallen fortresses one by one, taking them back from the monsters that now infest them. Can they rescue what remains of the once-unstoppable freedom fighters, or will they too fall to the ravages of Ibzairiak?

### Assault on Longshadow

Longshadow, a wealthy refinery town, now faces the perils of war. If the Ironfang Legion seizes the walled settlement, its grip will tighten across all of Nirmathas, and the local mines and refineries will grant it enough raw materials to fuel its engine of war indefinitely. But the Legion's heavy focus on Longshadow leaves its flanks vulnerable to a campaign of sabotage and harassment! Can the PCs end the hobgoblin siege, and in the process discover the secret behind the Ironfang Legion's lightning-quick raids and unseen troop movements?

### Siege of Stone

The secret to the Ironfang Legion's unstoppable conquest lies buried in myth and legend! To uncover their enemy's weakness, bold adventurers must confront degenerate morlocks, journey through the deadly Darklands below the world's surface, and explore an ancient dwarven vault lost to history. But a dark legacy stands in their way. Can the PCs survive the ghosts of Ironfang betrayal and return to the light of day with the key to the Legion's defeat—or will they join generations of the dead in the cold embrace of stone?

### Prisoners of the Blight

Strange and terrible things blossom deep within the Fangwood, twisting plant life and the fey residents into blighted monsters. Many have braved the forest, but Princess Arlantia—the cruel dryad who rules the forsaken woods—allows no trespasser to leave her realm. Yet somewhere within these cursed depths lies the key to the Ironfang Legion's hidden stronghold. Can the PCs survive wicked fey, a festering dragon, and nightmarish beasts? Or will they become prisoners of the blight?

### Vault of the Onyx Citadel

For months, the merciless Ironfang Legion has struck out against humanity from its impenetrable, otherworldly Onyx Citadel! But now in possession of a key to this stronghold, the bold adventurers must rally their allies, breach the barrier between worlds, tame an alien wilderness, and finally bring the fight to their hobgoblin conquerors! Can the heroes best the Legion's most devious commanders, including the unparalleled warrior-general Azaersi, or will they fall as readily as their homeland before hobgoblin blades?
