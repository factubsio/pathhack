## Chapters

### The Lost Outpost

The Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path begins with the adventurers standing on the deck of a ship ready to make landfall at their new home. However, dread settles in as they notice that the colony is empty and abandoned. Tasked with uncovering the whereabouts of the prior group of colonists, the adventurers go ashore and explore the deserted settlement. Uncovering strange evidence leads the adventurers across the island, where they encounter two survivors who can give them clues as to the fate of the rest of the first wave of settlers. Can the adventurers survive long enough to discover what truly befell the fledgling colony?

### Into the Shattered Continent

After working to secure their settlement on a surviving fragment of the lost continent of Azlant, the adventurers aid the colony by exploring the rest of the island to search for resources and look for potential dangers. Soon they learn of a sea hag whose attempts to revive the powerful oracular powers of the Azlanti threaten the island's inhabitants. But an even greater peril confronts them as they begin to notice that some people in the settlement are acting strangely—a haunting echo of the clues left behind after the original settlers vanished. Sinister forces are at work in the colony, and the adventurers must uncover a menacing threat to the settlement before they become the next victims of a vile plot.

### The Flooded Cathedral

As the adventurers work to track down the missing colonists, the trail leads to a nearby island. There, they discover the submerged ruins of a cathedral dedicated to a now-dead god; the site has become a lair of an ichthyic monster and its cunning minions. The adventurers must fight their way through flooded chambers and vicious monsters to rescue the kidnapped colonists and learn of a greater threat to the region—and to humanity as a whole.

### City in the Deep

On the trail of an ancient enemy, the heroes seek more information in a merfolk city teeming with intrigue just beneath the waves. They arrive to find a group of deep merfolk claiming that the city is in the path of a destructive sea monster. But this warning is nothing more than a ruse for the campaign's villain to uncover the location to a secret Azlanti military laboratory. The adventurers must carefully maneuver the social currents of the underwater city and unravel dangerous intrigue to get to the bottom of the merfolk's plot and discover where the ancient enemy is headed so they can stop it.

### Tower of the Drowned Dead

After learning that a powerful and ancient enemy is planning to steal a doomsday weapon and use it against humanity, the adventurers visit a ruined undersea tower belonging to an undead survivor of the cataclysm that destroyed ancient Azlant. In pursuit of the veiled master who they believe has infiltrated the tower, the heroes make their way through the submerged ruin, fighting against the tower's defenses and undead occupants only to realize that the veiled master already slipped out with the lich's phylactery and the location of the devastating weapon. Can the heroes also learn the location of the facility and escape alive to confront the veiled master or will they end up entombed in the drowned tower?

### Beyond the Veiled Past

The insidious alghollthus who sank Azlant beneath the treacherous ocean in ancient times mobilize their forces even as the heroes close on their enemies for a final confrontation. After preparing their allies for the impending assault, the heroes must fight their way through the submerged ruins of an ancient weapons facility packed with dangerous guardians and unstable magic to stop their monstrous foe before the veiled master unleashes a devastating eldritch attack to reignite the war against humanity, plunging the world into chaos just as the alghollthus did when they brought Azlant to ruin so long ago.
