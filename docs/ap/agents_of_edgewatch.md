## Chapters

### Devil at the Dreaming Palace

The Radiant Festival—the most magnificent centennial fair in the world—promises to be a celebration of life, joy, and freedom. But when tourists start going missing around the periphery of the fairgrounds, it's up to a squad of rookie law officers to navigate the mean streets of Absalom and figure out what's going on. Can our heroes sift through the everyday criminals to locate a mysterious kidnapper and put an end to their hellish schemes?

### Sixty Feet Under

After stopping a perilous bank robbery, the Edgewatch agents follow the money to uncover the source of the street-level corruption. Within a long-lost corner of Absalom's subterranean Catacombs, they find a cabal of murderous worshippers of the so-called Skinsaw Man. The agents will need to dig deeper than ever to take down the cult's leader—a bloodthirsty butcher known as the Skinner—and get to the bottom of the zealots' grand plot. The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with "Sixty Feet Under," a complete adventure for 4th- to 9th-level characters.

### All or Nothing

The Edgewatch agents resolve a bloody gang war in the Docks then go undercover to infiltrate the Floating Gala—a grandiose gathering of some of the Inner Sea's most famous power brokers—at the Lucky Nimbus Casino. To get at the contraband held in the casino's vault, the heroes will need to summon all the wit and guile they can muster. But with the mysterious Twilight Four pulling strings behind the scenes, nothing is quite as it seems! The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with "All or Nothing," a complete adventure for 9th- to 12th-level characters.

### Assault on Hunting Lodge Seven

Arresting the third member of the nefarious Twilight Four seemed too easy—until it wasn't. With the so-called Infector in chains, the Edgewatch agents find themselves and their suspect holed up in an abandoned guildhall as they wait out a torrential storm. To ensure their suspect is held to account for his crimes, the agents must defend Hunting Lodge Seven against mysterious assassins and assailants from both within and without. The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with "Assault on Hunting Lodge Seven," a complete adventure for 12th- to 15th-level characters.

### Belly of the Black Whale

The Edgewatch agents have been disgraced and the primarch thrown behind bars! In this, their darkest of hours, the heroes must delve into Absalom's criminal underbelly in order to reach the light. After earning the favor of one of Absalom's most notorious crime lords, they infiltrate the Black Whale, Absalom's infamous floating prison, to rescue the primarch and clear their names. The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with "Belly of the Black Whale," a complete adventure for 15th- to 18th-level characters.

### Ruins of the Radiant Siege

Only one member of the fiendish Twilight Four remains, but having completed her pact with the murderous god Norgorber, the already powerful politician has risen to new heights as she is imbued with both a spark of divinity and the authority of Absalom's crown. Now, the heroic Edgewatch agents must stop a massive, labyrinthine excavator before it stampedes the entire Radiant Festival fairgrounds, then secure a sacred relic long hidden in one of Absalom's most famous siege castles. With this powerful artifact in hand, all that's left is to ascend the reanimated nightmarescape of Beldrin's Tower and face off against the daemonic Gray Queen once and for all!
