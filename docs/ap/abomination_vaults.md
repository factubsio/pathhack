# Abomination Vaults

Abomination Vaults is the twenty-eighth Pathfinder Adventure Path and the first three-volume Pathfinder Adventure Path published by Paizo Inc., and ran from January 2021 to March 2021. It is loosely tied to the Second Edition Pathfinder Beginner Box, which is also set in Otari, and provides an easier to manage first campaign for players and gamemasters. It is also focused on a large dungeon complex, something Paizo had wanted to do for some time, but Paizo considered that six volumes would be too much to keep interest in a single site.1

## Chapters

### Ruins of Gauntlight

When the mysterious lighthouse called Gauntlight glows with baleful light, the people of Otari know it's an ominous prelude to sinister events. The town's newest heroes must explore the ruins around the lighthouse and delve down into the dungeon levels beneath it. Hideous monsters, deadly traps, and vengeful ghosts all await the heroes who dare to enter the sprawling megadungeon called the Abomination Vaults!

### Hands of the Devil

It's time to take weapons, torches, and wits into the deeper levels of the Abomination Vaults. Here, vile fleshcrafters labor to create armies of monsters for their long-dead leader, and a force of devils tries to maintain order among the feral and fractious hordes. An unlikely ally can reveal the deepest secrets of the Abomination Vaults, but his price is steep and must be paid in blood! The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path continues with "Hands of the Devil," a complete adventure for 5th- to 7th-level characters.

### Eyes of Empty Death

Massive caverns and a hidden shrine to a sinister Outer God await in the deepest levels of the Abomination Vaults. The heroes must negotiate the ruthless politics of insular drow, outwit vampiric urdefhans, and overcome stranger creatures to win the tools they need to vanquish Belcorra Haruvex. Yet the undead sorcerer still grows in power. The heroes must put her to rest before she claims the full might of her malevolent patron. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path concludes with "Eyes of Empty Death," a complete adventure for 8th- to 10th-level characters.
