## Chapters

### Kindled Magic

Education is far from easy at the oldest and most prestigious magic academy in the world! The newest students at the venerable Magaambya school of magic begin their academic careers with tests of skill and ingenuity. While all Magaambya students contend with the school's rigorous course load, these heroes must also investigate the strange infestations and supernatural intruders lurking in the school's ancient buildings. The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path begins with "Kindled Magic," a complete adventure for 1st- to 3rd-level characters.

### Spoken on the Song Wind

The students have proved their mettle to their instructors at the Magaambya, who now trust them to handle academy business in the surrounding metropolis of Nantambu, the Song-Wind City. Nantambu now faces more than its usual dangers, including a vengeful alchemist, stealthy infiltrators, and a crime boss bent on expanding her influence. Can the students discover the secrets of a mysterious artifact, protect their fellow classmates, and still graduate? The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path continues with "Spoken on the Song Wind," a complete adventure for 4th- to 7th-level characters.

### Hurricane's Howl

Lore-speakers are the teachers of the Magaambya school of magic, and the heroes have graduated and joined their ranks. Sent with their students to the edge of the Mwangi Expanse, these new teachers must unearth ancient ruins while keeping themselves and their students out of danger. When a student vanishes, the heroes uncover a nefarious plot to subjugate the rain-lashed Sodden Lands. They must liberate a town, stop an evil cult, and show their students how heroes stand as wardens of the world.

### Secrets of the Temple-City

As trusted teachers at the Magaambya school of magic, the heroes are sent on a delicate diplomatic mission to a city ruled by an evil mummy-god. During these negotiations, the heroes unearth the location of a wondrous hidden village that needs the Magaambya's knowledge and protection. But the mummy-god's military is on the march. If the heroes can't thwart the army, it will plunder the village's treasures and unleash an ancient evil contained since the world was covered in darkness!

### Doorway to the Red Star

Armed with the knowledge that a long-vanished ally lies on the other side of a magical portal called the Doorway to the Red Star, the heroes must earn the trust of the portal's guardians and then travel through it—to a planet of red sands and high adventure! Working to gain allies among scholarly brain creatures and shifty ratfolk, the heroes infiltrate a massive airship and fight to free their ally from an insidious trap. The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path continues with "Doorway to the Red Star," a complete adventure for 15th- to 17th-level characters.

### Shadows of the Ancients

The heroes return to the Magaambya magic academy to find that the villain they vanquished on a distant planet had long ago set up a sinister contingency scheme. Students and teachers have been twisted by evil magic, and the heroes must engage in legendary trials to free them. While a monstrous foe thrashes through the Magaambya, it's up to the heroes to save the school from utter destruction! The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path reaches its dramatic conclusion with "Shadows of the Ancients," a complete adventure for 18th- to 20th-level characters.
