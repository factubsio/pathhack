## Chapters

### The Choosing

When strange cards from a magical harrow deck manifest without explanation among the belongings of a group of powerful adventurers, the fate of reality falls on their shoulders. You are those adventurers! Are you up to the task of defending fate itself from those who seek to bend the forces of destiny to their whims? The Stolen Fate Adventure Path begins with "The Choosing," a complete adventure for 11th- to 13th-level characters.

### The Destiny War

More scattered cards of the mysterious and powerful Harrow deck known as the Deck of Destiny must be gathered before those who would use the Harrow's power to alter fate itself for their own needs can get them first. But this time, the cards come to the heroes when one of their competitors grows aggressive and attacks them in their own home. Only by gathering allies, exploring an ancient ruin, and exploring a corrupted demiplane can the heroes stand a chance over their latest enemy—a demonic mercenary who's taken an apocryphal Harrow card as his own identity.

### Worst of All Possible Worlds

The final cards of a powerful artifact based on the legendary Harrow deck finally lie within the grasp of the heroes who seek to defend the very future of reality from being set in stone, but fate itself has its own plans. Will the heroes of Stolen Fate make their own way into an unknown future and clash against the very creators of this potent magical artifact, or is destiny truly a force that cannot be withstood?
