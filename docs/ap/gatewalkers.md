## Chapters

### The Seventh Arch

In an instant, thousands vanished. Those who returned came back with strange powers, but without their memories of that fateful night. Seeking answers, the player characters search the hallowed forests of Sevenarches, finding paranoid townsfolk, violent druids, and an enigmatic bogeyman pulling strings from the shadows. Can the party unravel the schemes of Kaneepo the Slim? How does an ancient curse relate to their missing memories? And what awaits them beyond the Seventh Arch? The Gatewalkers Adventure Path begins in "The Seventh Arch," a complete adventure for 1st- to 4th-level characters.

### They Watched the Stars

The player characters join forces with a young oracle whose destiny is inextricably bound to theirs. To help fulfill her quest to find a living god and seal away an ancient evil, the party travels across frigid northlands, the demon-ravaged wastes of Sarkoris, and across harrowing waters where they must rely on their own wits, their new friends, and the stars above to guide them to safety.

### Dreamers of the Nameless Spires

The gatewalkers' quest for answers reaches its exciting conclusion when the characters reunite with Dr. Ritalson, but the occasion turns sour when they discover sinister dealings at home. The final leg of the party's quest to unravel their memory gaps and fulfill Sakuachi's destiny takes them to the Crown of the World, where ice-rimed temples and ancient alien evils await. The Gatewalkers Adventure Path concludes in "Dreamers of the Nameless Spires," a complete adventure for 8th- to 10th-level characters.
