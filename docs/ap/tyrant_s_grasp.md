## Chapters

### The Dead Roads

An unknown cataclysm thrusts the heroes into the Boneyard, where souls are judged after death... but the heroes aren't dead! Trapped in a tomb that isn't their own, they must use their wits and might to escape. The grim and otherworldly psychopomps who serve as the shepherds of souls are divided on what to do with these unexplained arrivals. The heroes must negotiate treacherous psychopomp politics and journey through a landscape of gloom and nightmare before walking the Dead Roads that can lead them home!

### Eulogy for Roslar's Coffer

Returning to the land of the living, the PCs explore the ruins of the town of Roslar's Coffer, the center of the devastating blast that sent them to the afterlife. Populated with newly risen undead, twisted creatures, and cultists of the Whispering Way, Roslar's Coffer offers danger around every corner. Will the PCs be able to escape the clouds of poisonous fog that encompass the town to warn the rest of the world of the rising threat to all life?

### Last Watch

The heroes race to the crusaders in Vigil to warn them of the Whispering Tyrant's devastating new weapon. Amid a city-wide celebration, Vigil's leaders are disinclined to believe incredible tales from the frontier, so the heroes must uncover the conspirators who seek to engineer the city's destruction. At the center of these schemes is a gang of thieves whose long-ago heist has finally brought old enemies to light. Will the heroes assemble the clues in time to warn others of the doom that hangs over Vigil?

### Gardens of Gallowspire

The Whispering Tyrant is free! The time to strike against him is now, before he recovers his full might and his long-dormant armies. Arazni, fallen demigoddess and queen of the dead lands of Geb, presents the heroes with a daring plan. The heroes must enter the dangerous land of Virlych, pass the bizarre profusion of alien plants and mutated wildlife around the Whispering Tyrant's former prison, and disable his arcane protections so that Arazni and the heroes can face the lich in battle. Yet Arazni's undead bodyguard-jailors seek to drag her back to Geb, and the remaining knights of Lastwall perceive both liches as their enemies. The heroes must navigate threats from both the living and the dead to stop the Whispering Tyrant from extending his grasp even further!

### Borne by the Sun's Grace

Mighty magic has hurled the heroes across the world to the continent of Arcadia, but their remarkable travel is no accident. In the land of Xopatl, the heroes find ancient legacies that unlock the secrets they have carried ever since they awoke in the realm of the dead. But this land of magic and wonder is no safe haven—agents of the Whispering Tyrant terrorize even this distant nation. If the heroes can overcome followers of wicked new gods and defend a city desperate to revitalize its lost magic, they might learn how to turn the tide against the Whispering Tyrant and put an end to his fearsome weapon forever. From lively festivals and masked brawlers to undead terrors and arcane botany gone horribly wrong, the heroes are sure to find more than they bargained for in a land unlike any other they've seen.

### Midwives to Death

The heroes finally have the tools they need to stop the Whispering Tyrant, but the lich-king has not been idle. Why has he devoted so much attention to an isolated border fortress, right when divinity seems to be within his grasp? A quest to discover the tyrant's secrets plunges the heroes into a deadly race through a fecund forest, into fearsome dungeons built long before the Shining Crusade, and between spiteful villains harboring ancient grudges. Old enemies stand in the heroes' way yet again, but unexpected allies can help turn the rising tide of death and despair. If the heroes are victorious, they can seize the only chance to deny the Whispering Tyrant his greatest weapon and strike him down before he gains the power of a god.
