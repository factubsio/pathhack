## Chapters

### Fires of Creation

The Iron Gods Adventure Path begins with "Fires of Creation," an exciting new adventure set in Numeria, land of barbarians and super-science! In the town of Torch, the settlement's unignorable tower of violet flame has gone out. The only clue to its disappearance is a newly discovered cave dug nearby. Are the heroes bold enough to unearth the otherworldly secrets that sleep beneath the city and reignite the fires of Torch? Or will their first foray into Numeria's ancient mysteries be their last?

### Lords of Rust

The heroes of the town of Torch follow a trail of clues to the sprawling junkyard known as Scrapwall, where bands of desperate and violent bandits vie for control over the technological leavings and ruins found within. The Lords of Rust dominate Scrapwall, and their swiftly rising power threatens more than the town of Torch. For they have the support of one of the Iron Gods of Numeria, and what slumbers fitfully beneath the wreckage of Scrapwall could catapult the Lords of Rust into a new level of power if they're not stopped!

### The Choking Tower

The Lords of Rust and their strange Iron God have been defeated, but the victory of Numeria's newest heroes has uncovered a threat to the land much greater than a mere gang of bandits. A mightier Iron God is rising in power in the enigmatic Silver Mount, but before the heroes can confront it, they must recover the legacy of this strange deity's first worshiper. Clues lead to the technophobic town of Iadenveigh, a farming community near the mysterious Choking Tower of technomancer Furkas Xoud. What role will this knowledge-obsessed "smoke wizard" play in this unfolding threat? Will the heroes be ready in time for their inevitable clash with Numeria's greatest Iron God?

### Valley of the Brain Collectors

After unearthing clues pointing them toward the legacy of a mysterious prophet, the heroes of Numeria must brave a remote canyon known as the Scar of the Spider, where they hope to uncover ancient knowledge to aid them in defeating the sinister Iron God of the Silver Mount. But the heroes aren't the first visitors to the distant valley—alien monstrosities from the darkest reaches of space have colonized the canyon, and hold their own horrific agendas. Can the heroes escape with their brains intact, or will they become the latest additions to a sinister, otherworldly collection?

### Palace of Fallen Stars

Numeria's capital city of Starfall sprawls in the shadow of the region's most infamous ruin, Silver Mount. Here, the sadistic Technic League and the Black Sovereign rule the land and control access to incredible and dangerous technological wonders, including the mysterious Silver Mount itself. Somewhere deep within that ruined starship, the greatest of the Iron Gods is rising to power. But before the heroes of Numeria can oppose it, they must contend with the Technic League and the Black Sovereign, for these oppressive rulers control access to the legendary site. Will the technological wonders gathered from across Numeria and the clues gleaned from an ancient android oracle be enough for the heroes to prevail, or will they be crushed under the Technic League's metal boot?

### The Divinity Drive

Silver Mount has long beckoned explorers and adventurers from across the Inner Sea with its promise of otherworldly treasures, but more than riches waits within this towering ruin's alien chambers. Here, the greatest of the Iron Gods dwells, inexorably drawing its plans against the world of flesh and preparing for its final triumphant emergence. With the brutish rulership of Starfall cowed, the time is right for the PCs to mount the most extensive and dangerous expedition ever made into Silver Mount's mysterious interior. What strange perils from beyond the stars await the heroes in one of Golarion's most legendary dungeons, and what insidious traps has the Iron God set for them within those metal walls?
