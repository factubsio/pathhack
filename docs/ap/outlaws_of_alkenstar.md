## Chapters

### Punks in a Powderkeg

A ragtag band of gunslinging outlaws get their hands dirty in the greasy alleyways and whisky-soaked saloons of Alkenstar, the City of Smog. To get revenge on the mogul who destroyed them, the renegades will have to stick up an illicit bank, foil a crooked shieldmarshal, and escort a reclusive inventor to safety. All the while, countless rough-and-tumble rivals aim to waylay the party and seize the inventor's latest concoction: pyronite, an explosive substance with the potential to change the face of the world. In a city where the clockwork guards are literally as tough as brass, the antiheroes will need true grit to dole out overdue justice.

### Cradle of Quartz

Time is of the essence when the formula for the devastating explosive pyronite falls into the wrong hands. To secure the formula and even the score with the sinister rival who ruined them, a motley gang of outlaws must brave the weird and wild wastes of the Spellscar Desert. At the center of this mutant-filled wasteland, the outlaws discover an abandoned temple of time called the Cradle of Quartz. But while redemption and a fresh start might be nice perks, the outlaws seek something far more valuable among the Cradle's time-warped halls: revenge.

### The Smoking Gun

Vengeance-seeking vigilantes must infiltrate Alkenstar's upper crust, master a potent combination of eldritch magic and clockwork engineering, and wield the awesome power of black powder to stop their archenemy's plot to upend the city. In this action-packed finale, the party members face their greatest challenges yet. Can they clear their names and settle their gunmetal grudges? Or will the forces of evil draw first?
