### The Summer That Never Was

Your hometown of Willowshore has always observed the final days of spring with a festival known as the Season of Ghosts—a celebration of life that honors and placates the region's many spirits. Yet this year something goes horribly wrong, and when you awake in the woods alone after a night of festivities, you find that your hometown is in dire need of heroes!

### Let the Leaves Fall

The town of Willowshore is cursed! As fall begins, the town's newest heroes find themselves in the position of leading preparations for the lean times to come. Yet the curse itself must be investigated as well, and when it becomes apparent that the answers might lie in a ruined monastery, the heroes must find a way to pass beyond the eerie Wall of Ghosts that blocks the only path!

### No Breath to Cry

With knowledge gained from a haunted monastery, the heroes of Willowshore are finally ready to take steps toward lifting the curse that's afflicted their hometown since the first day of summer, but now that winter has arrived, attempts to battle the supernatural forces that stand against them are complicated by the cruel realities of the year's most deadly season of all.

### To Bloom Below the Web

The eerie curse that afflicted the town of Willowshore might have been defeated, but the dangers facing the rural settlement are far from over. As the first days of spring arrive, conflicts with bandits and political perils threaten the town even as a greater supernatural peril begins to prey upon its citizens. Can Willowshore's heroes save their hometown from its greatest threat to date?
