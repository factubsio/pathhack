## Chapters

### Broken Tusk Moon

If the Broken Tusk following is to survive the coming year, their bravest scouts must carve a path through a harsh wilderness. Brutal beasts, wicked rivals, and an inhospitable landscape challenge the trailblazers to withstand their enemies and the elements. But mere survival is not enough. To forge their legacies as Mammoth Lords, the scouts search for an ancient artifact to light the way forward—the Primordial Flame! The Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path begins with "Broken Tusk Moon," a complete adventure for 1st- to 3rd-level characters.

### Lost Mammoth Valley

With danger close behind, the Broken Tusks journey through the bountiful but treacherous Lost Mammoth Valley in search of the Primordial Flame. The Tusks' scouts will need to solve the riddles of the ancient valley and recruit a motley league of followers, all while evading the watchful gaze of the vale's villainous overlords and unraveling a legendary artifact's mythical past. The Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path continues with "Lost Mammoth Valley," a complete adventure for 4th- to 7th-level characters.

### Burning Tundra

The Broken Tusks find sanctuary at last in the mountain settlement of Hillcross, but this peace is destined to be short-lived. To complete their quest and prove themselves worthy of the title of Mammoth Lords, the scouts must defend their people from a frost giant siege, survive the perils of a cursed wilderness, and wield the sacred light of the Primordial Flame to vanquish their ancient enemies once and for all. The Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path concludes with "Burning Tundra," a complete adventure for 8th- to 10th-level characters.
