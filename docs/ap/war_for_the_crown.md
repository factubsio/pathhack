## Chapters

### Crownfall

As Taldor's entire capital city gathers to celebrate, few realize that conspiracy and royal rivalries are about to shake the empire to its core! When a high-minded cabal of senators and nobles tries to steer the nation away from disaster, Emperor Stavian III orders a bloodbath in the senate halls, trapping neophyte spies inside layer upon layer of magical security. As tensions rise and the emperor falls, can the heroes escape the forgotten halls beneath the senate and save the heir to Taldor from an assassin's blade? And even then, can anyone prevent a civil war that will tear one of the Inner Sea's oldest nations apart at its rotting seams?

### Songbird, Scion, Saboteur

The county of Meratt is Taldor in a microcosm: a once-glorious land left to decay by negligent nobles. But to help secure Princess Eutropia's bid for the throne, bold adventurers must now infiltrate her ancestral homeland and overthrow the corrupt Count Lotheed from within, gaining allies and solving problems left to fester far too long. Can they play idle noble by day and hero by night well enough to reverse the county's fortunes, or will the weight of history's sins be too crushing a burden?

### The Twilight Child

Dark shadows haunt the trade city of Yanmass, spreading chaos even as the city's leaders debate which royal heir to support in the growing civil war. Their soldiers are vanishing, bandits attack without fear, and a mysterious plague of nightmares rattles the populace—are these troubles random, or part of a larger conspiracy? And what role do the mysterious Twilight Child and the cultlike following he has attracted play in the chaos?

### City in the Lion's Eye

As the War for the Crown escalates, General Pythareus—Princess Eutropia's rival for the throne—plots to plunge the nation into war, threatening to kill thousands of people to rally others to him. From the fortress-city of Zimar, he commands the overwhelming army of Taldor, as well as one of the most ruthless spymasters the world has ever known. Even with the resources of the legendary Lion Blades to aid them, can the PCs hope to outmaneuver conspiracy and prevent the War for the Crown from becoming a war between nations, or will Taldor again descend into a thousand years of violence?

### The Reaper's Right Hand

When no one sits upon the Lion Throne, all shall try! As a final act of vengeance, High Strategos Pythareus's agents release evidence that the entire Stavian family line may be illegitimate, and now every noble in Taldor is willing to risk civil war to stake a claim to the crown. Can the PCs discover the remains of the First Emperor's tomb and seek his blessing to prove Eutropia's fitness to rule? And if the spirit of Taldor's founder cannot answer their prayers, can they answer his?

### The Six-Legend Soul

As the heroes return to Taldor, they discover that strange seeds have finally borne fruit—conspiracy has laid their patron low. They must now face the cunning secret society, the Immaculate Circle, and put an end to its immortal machinations, finding new enemies along their path. To finally set the world right and end the War for the Crown, the heroes must confront not one but six of Taldor's greatest emperors, resurrected from the past! Can the heroes survive, or will Taldor's past sins forever define its future?
