## Chapters

### The Worldwound Incursion

For more than a hundred years, the demon-infested Worldwound has warred against humanity, its Abyssal armies clashing with crusaders, barbarians, mercenaries, and heroes along the border of lost Sarkoris. But when one of the magical wardstones that helps hedge the demons into their savage realm is sabotaged, the crusader city of Kenabres is attacked and devastated by the demonic hordes. Can a small band of heroes destined for mythic greatness survive long enough to hold back the forces of chaos and evil until help arrives, or will they become the latest in a long line of victims slaughtered by Deskari, the demon lord of the Locust Host?

### Sword of Valor

The Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path continues with "Sword of Valor," by RPG Superstar Neil Spicer. The PCs, now invested with righteous mythic power, are poised to become the greatest heroes of this seemingly endless war against the demons of the Worldwound… provided they can succeed at their first mission. The citadel city of Drezen was once a symbol of the First Crusade's triumph against the Worldwound, yet when a larger horde of demons attacked, they shattered Drezen's defenses and captured both the citadel and the crusaders' symbol of power. Can the PCs help lead an army north to reclaim Drezen and recover this potent relic, or are they marching their comrades and followers to a gruesome demise?

### Demon's Heresy

The Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path continues with "Demon's Heresy," by Jim Groves. After reclaiming the city of Drezen and recovering the lost sacred banner known as the Sword of Valor, the heroes have established a significant foothold behind enemy lines. With the demon armies still concentrating their attacks to the south, the heroes must now set off into the heart of the Worldwound to seek out powerful new allies and strike a mortal blow against the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth—but in doing so, they discover a disturbing truth about the crystalline source of mythic power the demons have been using against the crusaders. Will the heroes survive the terrors of the Worldwound long enough to end the demons' increasing attacks?

### The Midnight Isles

After an audience with the Crusader Queen, the heroes journey to a fortress that straddles the boundary between this world and the demon-haunted realm of the Abyss. There, they must face powerful agents of the architects of the Worldwound and put a stop to the production of the powerful elixirs being used to grant demons mythic power. Beyond the fortress lies the Abyssal realm of the Midnight Isles, lair of the succubus queen Nocticula—and the source of the crystals used to create the mystical elixirs. Can the heroes navigate the intrigues of the Midnight Isles to strike a critical blow for the forces of good? And can they avoid losing their souls to darkness in the process?

### Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth

The cult of Baphomet has been delivered a critical blow, yet the demon lord remains undeterred. Now he's taken hostage the herald of Iomedae, goddess of justice and valor. The heroes of the Fifth Crusade must attempt their most dangerous and audacious mission yet—travel to Baphomet's Abyssal realm known as the Ivory Labyrinth, navigate its trackless mazes, and find the ancient prison in which he's keeping the abducted herald. Can the heroes rescue the goddess's messenger, or are they already too late? And was the abduction merely a ruse by the demon lord to lure the heroes into his clutches?

### City of Locusts

The heroes of the Fifth Crusade have risen to undreamed of heights of power and have dealt blow after blow to the demonic armies of the Worldwound. As they return from their last foray into the Abyss, however, they find that their enemies are no longer just sending minions after them—now they've drawn the attention not only of the leaders of the Worldwound, but even of their demonic patron, Deskari, Lord of the Locust Host. Permanently closing the Worldwound is within the heroes' grasp, but in order to achieve their goal, they must venture where no crusader has ever returned from intact: the crumbling City of Locusts. There, they must defeat its powerful demonic ruler—yet even this is just a stepping stone to the final battle against Deskari himself!
