## Chapters

### In Hell's Bright Shadow

The city of Kintargo has long been a safe haven for artists, freethinkers, and those marginalized by the oppressive Chelaxian government, but now the city has been placed under martial law by inquisitor Barzillai Thrune. When a protest turns into a riot, a new group of heroes comes together to form an organized resistance against the devil-binding government and the church of Asmodeus—but can they survive long enough to establish allies? Or will they become the latest victims of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune?

### Turn of the Torrent

The rebel group known as the Silver Ravens once fought for independence in the city of Kintargo, but after the Chelaxian Civil War came to an end, they disbanded—until today! Now, new heroes have reestablished the organization to stand against the inquisitor Barzillai Thrune and his oppressive diabolic regime. But before the Silver Ravens can rise up, they need allies—friends among powerful groups like the Order of the Torrent Hellknights, a hidden cult of Milani, and disenfranchised agents of the government itself. But until the heroes find the ideal hideout for their rebellion—a place secret enough and strong enough to withstand the battles to come—they'll be forced to stay in the shadows. When a perfect site for their headquarters comes along, will the heroes survive long enough to claim it as their own?

### Dance of the Damned

Having successfully established a hideout in the city of Kintargo, the heroes of the growing rebellion are poised to take back the city. But before the Silver Ravens can strike against diabolic House Thrune, they must forge alliances with nearby tribes of aquatic elves and the free city of Vyre to cut off Cheliax's easy sea and land routes, forcing Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune to rely solely on his resources at hand to defend his control of Kintargo. Yet nothing is as simple as it seems, and the dangers awaiting the rebels are not always those that can be defeated with a spell or a sword. And, of course, Barzillai Thrune won't take these new developments lying down—what retribution might one of Cheliax's most dangerous inquisitors have in store for the Silver Ravens?

### A Song of Silver

It's the one hundredth volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path! Too long has the diabolic Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune inflicted cruelties and increasingly oppressive laws on his citizens. The heroes of the beleaguered city of Kintargo finally strike back at the sources of corruption, as their rebellion mobilizes in the streets. Rescuing old heroes from forgotten prison cells, reclaiming control of key locations, and performing an ancient song that was used years ago to protect the city from Hell's agents are but the preamble for the decisive battle—an assault on the enormous Temple of Asmodeus!

### The Kintargo Contract

The Silver Ravens have defeated Paracount Barzillai Thrune and liberated Kintargo, but unless steps are taken to protect what they've won, it's only a matter of time before Cheliax's rulers respond with open war—one that could likely destroy the Silver City. The key to the city's last defense may lie hidden in a sprawling scroll recovered from the wicked inquisitor: the Kintargo Contract. Within this contract's clauses and stipulations lurks a cunning loophole that gives the heroes an opportunity to use Cheliax's own love of law against it, not only securing the city, but also freeing the surrounding region from the infernal machinations of House Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus. Yet as the heroes scramble to parse the contract and Kintargo reels from its recent upheavals, an old menace from the city's past strikes. Before Kintargo can be truly safe, the Silver Ravens must save the city from a monster of its own making!

### Breaking the Bones of Hell

With the Kintargo Contract recovered and alliances in place, the Silver City and the surrounding region of Ravounel is shielded from Chelaxian invasion. Yet as Kintargo's heroes ready treaties to secure the area's independence, enemies made in the liberation effort remain active. Worse, the onetime despotic ruler of Kintargo, Barzillai Thrune, lives on in Hell, and his plans have only been slowed. Strange manifestations and infernal hauntings throughout Kintargo reveal the truth—that the  inquisitor's death has only empowered him, and the secret to stopping him hides in Hell's depths! Can Kintargo's heroes brave the Pit to forever save the city from Barzillai Thrune?
