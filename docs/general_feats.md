# General Feats

General feats at levels 3, 9, 15, 19. Pool is shuffled per run, maybe 2/3 chosen?

## Standalone Feats

**Toughness**
- +level HP
- CL 10: Ferocity (act at 0 HP for 1 round)

**Fleet**
- -2 move cost (base 12 → 10)
- CL 10+: -3 move cost

**Blind-Fight**
- No blind/invisible penalties (primarily on attack rolls)
- CL +5: Tremorsense (detect adjacent) - granting at +5CL is kind cool 

**Evasion**
- Reflex save success: half → no damage
- Stacks with class evasion for rank 2 (fail → half)

uncanny dodge is similar to evasion (to the point always mix them up) but we're less in the flat footed systems yet

**Fast Recovery**
- 2x resting HP regen
- Chance to shrug off disease/poison per turn, maybe CL scaled?

**Feather Step**
- Ignore difficult terrain (in pf I am not sure grease counts, but defo you'll ignore grease and stuff)

**Trap Sense**
- Bonus to detect traps
- Bonus to saves vs traps

## Stealth Chain

Tier 1:
- **Stealthy** - reduced detection range, bonus to stealth (or just grant stealth)?

Tier 2 (15+, requires Stealthy):
- **Legendary Sneak** - always hidden unless you choose not to be, this could be way over strong, but it's lvl15 and needs the probabnly underperforming stealthy feat?

**Dirty Fighting**
- Melee hits have chance to inflict random debuff (blind/slow/clumsy)

## Combat Stance Chain

Tier 1 (pick one):
- **Power Attack** - toggle: -2 hit, +4 damage
- **Lunge** - attack at +1 range, -AC until next turn
- **Knockback** - hits push enemy 1 tile
- **Reckless Attack** - toggle: +2 hit, -2 AC

Tier 2 (15+, requires any tier 1):
- **Combat Stances** - unlock toggle between all stances (PA/Lunge/Knockback/Reckless/Cleave)

## Intimidate Chain

Tier 1 (pick one):
- **Dazzling Display** - demoralize hits target + adjacent enemies (AoE fear)
- **Cornugon Smash** - melee hits trigger free demoralize

Tier 2 (15+, requires any tier 1):
- **Scare to Death** - frightened enemies can die

this is either lol strong or not - Phantasmal killer intensifies (talking of which should we do pk for the lols? GIVE IT TO MONSTERS???)

## Spell Penetration Chain

Tier 1 (pick one):
- **Elemental Mastery** - ignore X energy resistance + bonus elemental damage
- **Spell Focus** - +1 DC to spell saves
- **Spell Penetration** - +X to overcome SR
- **Arcane Force** - +damage on force/untyped magic

Tier 2 (15+, requires any tier 1):
- **Arcane Supremacy** - double your tier 1 effect + weak versions of others

## Spell Conservation Chain

Tier 1 (pick one):
- **Spell Conservation** - X% chance to not consume slot
- **Blood Magic** - when out of slots, cast by paying HP
- **Arcane Reservoir** - spell damage/DC scales with % slots remaining

Tier 2 (15+, requires any tier 1):
- **Spell Surge** - double your tier 1 effect + weak versions of others

## Standalone Capstones (15+)

**Eye of the Arclords**
- Darkvision
- Auto-detect magic items/traps
- Perception bonus

**Cloud Jump**
- Jump 2+ tiles reliably (jumping should be distance-based check, this would probably give you jump at nh range with 100% chance, and increase chance for bigger ranges)
- Extended range - maybe jump to unseen? tbd, it's not got pre-reqs so it may become "mandatory" which would be against the point

## Maybe Later

- **Iron Stomach** - instant intrinsic from corpses (needs eating system)
- **Legendary Survivalist** - no food/water, temp immunity (needs hunger)
- Buff duration feats
